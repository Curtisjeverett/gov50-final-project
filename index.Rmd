## Project thoughts

In my final project, I am interested in investigating the variables that contribute to crime rates in all 67 counties in Pennsylvania. The two main variables that I will analyze is the relationship between income per capita on crime rate and the relationship between race on crime rate. My hypothesis is that income will be more telling of crime rate than racial factors. I will analyze other variables as well, such as age and education, as I understand there could be a possibility that the counties with lowest income are also the counties with highest percentage of minority residents, which would bias my data and make it hard to form a link between one variable on crime rate.
